# Mentions of works
<details>
  <summary>Warframe.Trade</summary>
  
  ### Summary
  In 2015, I developed an unofficial trading system for Warframe players because, at that time, the game lacked a developed trading system.
  
  ### Motivation
  Players had to manually analyze the trading chat or send out their offers for exchange.
  The site offered a search and product database, price ratings, and other marketing tools that made life easier for players.  

  ### Topics on Official Forum of the Game:

  <summary>Warface.Lol</summary>

  ### Summary
  This project was one of my early works that gained popularity in a particular social group.

  It was a purely client-side web application. I enjoyed creating it simply because it was aesthetically pleasing and one-of-a-kind. I aimed to make the interface closely resemble the original game's interface.
  
  ### Features:
  
  - A spinner for loot boxes (no financial investments, just for fun)
  - Collection of player statistics
  - Userbar generator with overlay options.

  <summary>BDO Boss Tracker</summary>

  ### Summary
  It was a small application that analyzed messages in the Discord gaming channel and displayed the gathered information on the website in infographic form.

  ### Motivation
  The application helped Black Desert Online players increase their efficiency in boss hunting by reducing the difficulties associated with calculating boss respawn times. It also provided up-to-date information from other game servers. The project's architecture involved social engineering, as player-generated data on bosses was collected from specific Discord chat channels.
