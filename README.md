My name is Dmitry, and I'm an experienced developer with `Effector`, `Redux`, `React`, `NextJs`, and `Typescript`.

Among my recent achievements, I would like to highlight the creation and successful launch of an MVP project that attracted investments from shareholders affiliated with "Skolkovo."

I value the practice of writing unit tests, as I have rich experience working with fast-growing companies that often overlook this practice.

# Mentions of Pet Projects
<details>
  <summary>Warframe.Trade</summary>
  
  ### Summary
  In 2015, I developed an unofficial trading system for Warframe players because, at that time, the game lacked a developed trading system.
  
  ### Motivation
  Players had to manually analyze the trading chat or send out their offers for exchange.
  The site offered a search and product database, price ratings, and other marketing tools that made life easier for players.  

  ### Topics on Official Forum of the Game:
  [One](https://forums.warframe.com/topic/496059-fix-consoles-awesome-trading-warframetrade-pc-ps4-xbox1-not-auction-fixed-links/?ct=1693251125), [Two](https://forums.warframe.com/topic/455554-%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BB%D1%8F-%D0%BD%D0%B0-warframetrade-pcps4xbox1/?ct=1693251116)

  <summary>Warface.Lol</summary>

  ### Summary
  This project was one of my early works that gained popularity in a particular social group.

  It was a purely client-side web application. However, I partially used a CMS for routing and a PHP template engine. I enjoyed creating it simply because it was aesthetically pleasing and one-of-a-kind. I aimed to make the interface closely resemble the original game's interface.
  
  ### Features
  - A spinner for loot boxes (no financial investments, just for fun)
  - Collection of player statistics
  - Userbar generator with overlay options.

  <summary>BDO Boss Tracker</summary>

  ### Summary
  It was a small application that analyzed messages in the Discord gaming channel and displayed the gathered information on the website in infographic form.

  ### Motivation
  The application helped Black Desert Online players increase their efficiency in boss hunting by reducing the difficulties associated with calculating boss respawn times. It also provided up-to-date information from other game servers. The project's architecture involved social engineering, as player-generated data on bosses was collected from specific Discord chat channels.
