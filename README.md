# Mentions of works
<details>
  <summary>Warface.lol</summary>
  
  This project was one of my early works that gained popularity in a particular social group.

  It was a purely client-side web application. I enjoyed creating it simply because it was aesthetically pleasing and one-of-a-kind. I aimed to make the interface closely resemble the original game's interface.
  
  There were several features:
  
  - A spinner for loot boxes (no financial investments, just for fun)
  - Collection of player statistics
  - Userbar generator with overlay options.
    
  In 2013, when I joined the startup CyberArenaPro, I had to abandon the project. As a result, only video recordings remain from the project, which were created by community members of the game.

  <summary>BDO boss tracker</summary>
  
  It was a small application that analyzed messages in the Discord gaming channel and displayed the gathered information on the website in infographic form.

  ## Motivation
  The application helped Black Desert Online players increase their efficiency in boss hunting by reducing the difficulties associated with calculating boss respawn times. It also provided up-to-date information from other game servers.
