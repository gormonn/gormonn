# Mentions of works
## warface.lol
<details>

  Warface.lol - This is my third project after renovating second one "uzerbar.ru".

It was a purely client-side web application. I enjoyed creating it simply because it was aesthetically pleasing and one-of-a-kind. I aimed to make the interface closely resemble the original game's interface.

There were several features:

- A spinner for loot boxes (no financial investments, just for fun)
- Userbar generator
  
In 2013, when I joined the startup CyberArenaPro, I had to abandon the project. As a result, only video recordings remain from the project, which were created by community members of the game.

## BDO boss
<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  
  It was a small application that analyzed messages in the Discord gaming channel and displayed the gathered information on the website in infographic form.

### Motivation
The application helped Black Desert Online players increase their efficiency in boss hunting by reducing the difficulties associated with calculating boss respawn times. It also provided up-to-date information from other game servers.
