This project was one of my early works that gained popularity in a particular social group.

It was a purely client-side web application. I enjoyed creating it simply because it was aesthetically pleasing and one-of-a-kind. I aimed to make the interface closely resemble the original game's interface.

There were several features:

- A spinner for loot boxes (no financial investments, just for fun)
- Collection of player statistics
- Userbar generator with overlay options.
  
In 2013, when I joined the startup CyberArenaPro, I had to abandon the project. As a result, only video recordings remain from the project, which were created by community members of the game.
